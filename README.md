# My portfolio with projects and exercices

This is a collection of my Udacity Projects for the Front End Nanodegree Program.

## Project Requirements

The aim of this project was to build a portfolio, as part of the Front-End Nanodegree Program (Udacity), with at least four images, a title text with h1, h2, etc., a regular paragraph text and a logo. The project should follow a mockup. And other minor code criteria. The portfolio has since been adapted to fit my own criteria.


## Working process

As layout system I used flexbox, for the project section, and a 3-column system for the textbox. I found the 3-column system very useful for its capability to make the text goes to the next line or column without breaking the flow and adapting itself to all devices. I also used hyphenation to make the syllables be separated like in a book.

Thinking on the user, I introduced a button to show or hide text content, so that the reader of little screens would not have to scroll unnecessarily. And I also I tried to reduce the resolution to its minimum while maintaining an acceptable image quality to enables high load pages. The images are as well responsive.

At the first I planned to put all the images in svg code. I made them with Adobe Draw and Adobe Illustrator to be vector files. Because the size was too big for the html, I transformed them in “jpg low”, for as png, it had a bigger size and slow load speed with the same quality of image. For the main image I used a svg code, instead of transforming it on svg file or png.  I tried, when it was possible, to put the style of the svg in the css file. I also searched to make the svg code accessible by screen readers.


## Things that will be changed

The “towns news” was an exercise that we had to ameliorate. Though its images and svg code were all completely made by me. This placeholder exercise will be excluded, changed or be replaced by another main project in the future. The pixel-art-maker is still under construction, for the design looks not satisfying for me.


## Authorization

You can use my images if you cite my name.

## Content added from other sources
The gif of the Animals Trading Card was not made by me. I only took the link and attached it to my project. For the exercise placeholder, there are bits of code that were not written by me. Although I worked on the code a lot.

As a source of learning to code, I looked at W3Schools and DevTools. I also used code that I learned during the Udacity’s course, as well as made use of the knowledge of the course “Responsive Images” of Udacity.
