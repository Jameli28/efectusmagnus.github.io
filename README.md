# My portfolio with projects and exercices

This is a collection of my Udacity Projects for the Front End Nanodegree Program.

## Project Requirements

The aim of this project was to build a portfolio, as part of the Front-End Nanodegree Program (Udacity), with at least four images, a title text with h1, h2, etc., a regular paragraph text and a logo. The project should follow a mockup. And other minor code criteria. The portfolio has since been adapted to fit my own criteria.


## Working process

As layout system I used flexbox, for the project section, and a 3-column system for the textbox. I found the 3-column system very useful for its capability to make the text goes to the next line or column without breaking the flow and adapting itself to all devices. I also used hyphenation to make the syllables be separated like in a book.

Thinking on the user, I introduced a button to show or hide text content, so that the reader of little screens would not have to scroll unnecessarily. And I also I tried to reduce the resolution to its minimum while maintaining an acceptable image quality to enables high load pages. The images are as well responsive.

At the first I planned to put all the images in svg code. I made them with Adobe Draw and Adobe Illustrator to be vector files. Because the size was too big for the html, I transformed them in “jpg low”, for as png, it had a bigger size and slow load speed with the same quality of image. For the main image I used a svg code, instead of transforming it on svg file or png.  I tried, when it was possible, to put the style of the svg in the css file. I also searched to make the svg code accessible by screen readers.
